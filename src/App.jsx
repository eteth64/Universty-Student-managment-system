// This is the main entry point of the application. It imports the AppRoutes component, which contains all the routes for the application. The App component renders the AppRoutes component, which is then rendered to the DOM in the main.jsx file.
// The App component is a functional component that returns a div with the class "App" containing the AppRoutes component. This structure allows for easy organization and management of the application's routes and components.
